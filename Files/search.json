Trousers fall, it is true, but in an instantaneous way as if by divine intervention. Habeas Corpus is a favourite of mine if only because it’s one of the few times I’ve tried to write a naturalistic play…There are plenty of good arts - henpecked husband, frustrated wife, lecherous curate, ubiquitous char - and everyone is slightly larger than life. “\n",

Pickering is intrigued by Higgins’s boast and wagers that he cannot make good on his claim; Higgins takes on the challenge and begins an intensive make-over of Eliza’s speech, manners and dress in preparation for her appearance at the Embassy Ball. Complicating matters is Eliza’s father Alfred, a cheerfully amoral and drink-loving dustman who shows up, supposedly to save his daughter’s virtue, but in reality hoping to extract money from Higgins.\n\nMade famous by the film starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison, this is the tale of a girl taken from rags to riches, featuring such classic songs as ‘Wouldn’t it be loverly’, ‘On the street where you live’ and ‘Get me to the church on time’. Expect extravagant Ascot hats and an abundance of cockney jigs…\n",

The attractive and playful Lizzie, is courted by Rufus, a local youth with a criminal background and a less than encouraging future. Feeling the duty to protect his sister and his family name, Jack is forced to defend his sister, bringing him into a world completely different from his own. This new, crooked environment tests the limits of Jack’s mental endurance, facing an inner battle of whether to return to the straight and narrow of his previous life, or go through with the new demands placed on him by his criminal superiors.\n\nAn ensemble, devised piece being led by artistic director Simon Thompson (see award-winning ‘Slippery Soapbox’) and produced by NT Treasurer Jackie Lee.\n\nThe Die Is Cast…\n",

As the story unfolds the landlady is forced to examine her life and reflect upon her inadequacies as well as the need for redemption that she has only a swearing, thieving, whoring, boozing old outlaw to help her find. Deus Vult is not a historical play; it is a modern play about relatable people struggling with the timeless issues of fear, loyalty and morality. Above all it is about humanity’s never-ending struggle to seek a glimmer of light in a world of filth and emptiness.\n\nDeus Vult promises to be a moving and powerful performance from a new piece of student-brewed writing.\n",

Forced to go to the home by her mother, Mary along with the other girls, has to cope with the shame of her situation and the dawning realisation that her baby will be taken away and given up for adoption whether she likes it or not. Despite the hard hitting nature of the play, the youthfulness and positive spirit of the girls is echoed in the 1960s girl-group music which they sing along to.\n\nInspired by the real accounts and heart-breaking memories from the women Amanda Whittington interviewed, Be My Baby provides for us a glimpse into a part of our shockingly recent social history that for too long was shut away and ‘forgotten’.\n",

Electric Nebraska explores the central ideas that are crucial to an understanding of American national identity amidst a 70s soundtrack, while capturing the rhythmic heartbeat of a working-class community.

Miss Blake\n\nIt is 1896 and Tess has begun her education at Girton College, Cambridge – home to the country’s first female students and an object of contempt and derision for the rest of the university.\n\nUnable to graduate, yet matching their male peers grade for grade, Tess and her fellow students begin to notice their stigma as ‘bluestockings’ – unnatural, educated women. Endangered by their position as unqualified and unmarriagable, they must fight to change the history of education.\n\nFacing economic difficulty, the distractions of love and senseless prejudice the women dare to confront outdated social practices in order to live life to the full. Blue Stockings follows the women over one tumultuous academic year, in their fight for the right to graduate.\n\nIn 2017, as new financial barriers to university spring up and the issue of women’s access to education all over the world is rarely off the news, many of the questions the play raises feel as significant and relevant now as ever.\n",

Jessica is daunted by the experiences that take her into adulthood, slowly realising what her weaknesses are. Abbie is Jessica’s childhood friend, who is understanding of her insecurities. She looks after Jessica as much as she can, but can’t always be there for her. In spite of this, Abbie promises that she will never stop watching over Jessica. Infectious is a playful and moving two-woman audience-interaction show that uses improvisation. It deals with the experiences that connect us all: the stresses of becoming an adult, the long-lasting bonds we form with our loved ones, and how it feels when those bonds are broken.\n",

Set within an unnamed totalitarian state, Katurian is questioned by detectives Tupolski and Ariel who adopt an unconventional dynamic to determine Katurian’s involvement in the atrocities. When the detectives reveal that they have also detained Katurian’s brother Michal, things become more complex and Katurian realises that he may be more culpable than previously thought. Martin McDonagh’s (In Bruges, The Cripple of Inishmaan) black comedy explores the nature of censorship and the responsibility of art in a time when fiction can be considered as dangerous as reality. This production is presented by Coronet Productions in association with the Nottingham New Theatre.\n",

Rebecca has spiralled into a cycle of rage, despair, sadness and anger she cannot control in the wake of ending a long-term relationship. Sam is discovering his new identity in a world of violence and discrimination, that is preventing him from becoming his true authentic self. When these three strangers come into contact with each other, their lives are changed forever. Passionate, complex, furious and funny, Swallow promises to be an emotional and visceral experience. One that explores the difficulties of surviving in the modern world, exposes us to the darkest corners of our minds, but reinforces the power we have to overcome even our darkest and most vulnerable moments.\n",

Although Chekhov intended it as a comedy, and it does contain some elements of farce, Stanislavski insisted on directing the play as a tragedy. Since this initial production, directors have had to contend with the dual nature of the play. The play is often identified on the short list of the three or four outstanding plays written by Chekhov along with The Seagull, Three Sisters, and Uncle Vanya.\n\nThe play concerns an aristocratic Russian woman and her family as they return to their family estate (which includes a large and well-known cherry orchard) just before it is auctioned to pay the mortgage. While presented with options to save the estate, the family essentially does nothing and the play ends with the sale of the estate to the son of a former serf; the family leaves to the sound of the cherry orchard being cut down. The story presents themes of cultural futility‚ both the futile attempts of the aristocracy to maintain its status and of the bourgeoisie to find meaning in its newfound materialism. In reflecting the socio-economic forces at work in Russia at the turn of the 20th century, including the rise of the middle class after the abolition of serfdom in the mid-19th century and the sinking of the aristocracy, the play reflects forces at work around the globe in that period.\n",

Like John Bunyan’s 1678 Christian novel The Pilgrim’s Progress, Everyman uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one’s life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, (material) Goods, and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatised by the interactions between characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him. Everyman learns that when you are brought to death and placed before God all you are left with is your own good deeds.\n",

The play begins with a mutual vow reminiscent of the vow beginning the play Lysistrata in which Greek women vow to deny men sex to protest the Peloponnesian War. The three women teachers mutually pledge to abstain from sexual intercourse, in protest against the dominance and abusive treatment of women by men, epitomized in the slur against women as “slags.” Conflicts among the teachers’ different visions of radical feminism, different motivations, and different interpretations of and commitment to the vow become the grist for duplicitous dominant and abusive acts among them and distracts them from their teaching. Dominance and Feminism are ridiculed alike, while the number of pupils dwindles to zero in the resulting dysfunctional environment, leaving the three teachers to go their separate ways.\n\nSlag was a breakthrough play for David Hare. Reputedly written by Hare in three days time, working out of the back of a van, it won for him the Evening Standard (London) Award for most promising new playwright and launched his prolific and successful career as a playwright.\n",

The play is in three acts, normally taking a little less than three hours to perform, with two 10-minute intermissions. The title is a pun on the song “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?” from Walt Disney’s Three Little Pigs (1933), substituting the name of the celebrated English author Virginia Woolf. Martha and George repeatedly sing this version of the song throughout the play.\n",

A product of the tolerant early Restoration period, the play reflects an aristocratic and anti-Puritan ideology, and was controversial for its sexual explicitness even in its own time. The title itself contains a lewd pun. It is based on several plays by Molière, with added features that 1670s London audiences demanded: colloquial prose dialogue in place of Molière’s verse, a complicated, fast-paced plot tangle, and many sex jokes. It turns on two indelicate plot devices: a rake’s trick of pretending impotence to safely have clandestine affairs with married women, and the arrival in London of an inexperienced young “country wife”, with her discovery of the joys of town life, especially the fascinating London men.\n\nThe scandalous trick and the frank language have for much of the play’s history kept it off the stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924, The Country Wife was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick’s cleaned-up and bland version The Country Girl, now a forgotten curiosity. The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by academic critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, and openness to different interpretations.\n",

They persuade the Queen to summon Iolanthe and forgive her. On her arrival she reveals that she has a son who is half a fairy - his legs are mortal. Strephon, who now enters, tells his mother and his ‘aunts’ that he is anxious to marry Phyllis, a Ward of Chancery, but is prevented by the Lord Chancellor. The Fairy Queen promises Strephon any help he wishes. After Strephon and Phyllis sing of their love for each other the Peers enter with ‘Loudly Let the Trumpet Bray’. The Lord Chancellor still holds his consent to the marriage between Strephon and Phyllis. Strephon, in despair, consults his mother, but Phyllis (seeing him with a young woman) assumes he is being unfaithful. He calls to the Fairy Queen for help and Act I ends with her and the fairies telling the Peers that Strephon can go into Parliament and wreak havoc there.\nAt the start of Act II, Private Willis, on guard at Westminster, meditates on the political scene. At a second meeting between Phyllis and Strephon, in which Strephon manages to explain his situation, the are reunited and ask Iolanthe to intercede for them with the Lord Chancellor. She does, although if she goe to him and is recognised, she will be condemned to death. Why? - well, we’d hate to spoil the story for you!\n",

First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James’s Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play’s major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play’s humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde’s artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde’s most enduringly popular play\n",

Soon after this the anarchist Guiseppe Pinelli was held for questioning in the Milanese Police Headquarters, while another anarchist, Pietro Valpreda was similarly pulled in in Rome. Pinelli was killed when he “fell” from the fourth floor window of the police interrogation room. The militant left-wing newspaper, Lotta Continua, was not slow to accuse Calabresi, the police inspector in charge, of the “murder” of Pinelli.\n\nThese are the facts on which Fo’s play was based in 1970. Fo had been quick to see the enormous dramatic potential of this real-life farce and to turn it to political advantage.\n",

Upon meeting Viola, Countess Olivia falls in love with her thinking she is a man. The play expanded on the musical interludes and riotous disorder expected of the occasion, with plot elements drawn from the short story “Of Apollonius and Silla” by Barnabe Rich, based on a story by Matteo Bandello. The first recorded performance was on 2 February 1602, at Candlemas, the formal end of Christmastide in the year’s calendar. The play was not published until its inclusion in the 1623 First Folio.\n",

To make direct edits you must be added as a trusted editor to the repository by an owner however you can propose edits straight away for an editor to merge in.\n\nYou can either use the GitHub website or using a text editor on your computer. Either way you’ll need a free GitHub account, you can sign up here.\n\nEnsure you have a verified email address with GitHub otherwise your changes will not trigger a build.\n\nEditing Online\n\nGitHub\n\n\n\nTo use the GitHub website use the  Improve This Page button on the right hand edge of a page to launch the editor.\n\nIf you’re not a trusted editor you’ll be prompted to create a fork and will be led through the process of creating a pull request. Later an editor will check your changes are valid and merge them into the repo.\n\nEditing Locally\n\nThis method requires a certain amount of technical knowledge.\n\nThis is the more complicated option, the benefits are you can use a desktop text editor and run the entire site on your machine to preview changes before they go live. You should have knowledge of Git and the command line to do this.\n\nSee README.md for up to date install instructions.\n\nGetting the site running on your machine locally is easy to do on Mac and Linux. It can be done on Windows, but it’s tricky. The website Run Jekyll on Windows has a full tutorial on how to do this.\n\nSyntaxes Used\n\nA combination of HTML and Markdown (Kramdown variant) is used for marking up our pages. YAML is used for meta data and is documented for shows, committees etc here.\n\nThe Kramdown syntax guide is useful for reference.\n",

The Jekyll static site generator - which runs on every authorised change from a Travis CI build - then turns the constituent parts of the project into the built site in front of you. The built site is hosted from a separate repository by the GitHub Pages service.\n\nSuper Secret Editors’ Mode\n\nIf you type the word editor - go on try it - while this site is active you’ll enable a secret editors’ / debuggy mode. Extra (ugly) content will be shown - for example show counts next to years on the archive page. If these items seem a bit cryptic hover over them and hope someone left a tooltip description.\n\nWith editors’ mode enabled the ‘Improve this page’ dialogue is bypassed.\n",

Websites may close or re-arrange their URLs rendering our links broken. To protect against this editors should create snapshots of resources when they link to them. These snapshots save the state of those resources at a single point in time. Unless the archiving service closes we should have a permanent record of all resources with snapshots.\n\nWe currently use archive.is to create snapshots. Snapshots are created by entering the URL of the resource to be saved on the archive.is website. A page will be returned with a five-character reference code in the URL. For example archiving example.com returns page whose URL is https://archive.fo/oYs92, the reference code is oYs92. This code should be placed in the snapshot attribute of the link list item.\n\n Example Link List\n\nlinks:\n  - type: Example Domain\n    href: \"https://example.com\"\n    snapshot: oYs92\n    title: Example Domain\n  - type: News Story\n    href: \"https://news.com/a-story\"\n    snapshot: abc12\n    title: A Story\n    date: 1980-01-01\n    quote: \"A very interesting quotation.\"\n\n",

Interrogated by two brutal detectives, he claims to know nothing of such murders. But also in their custody is his younger, brain damaged brother, who perhaps knows more than he first lets on. A darkly comic thriller like no other.\n\n",

        "content": " History of the Nottingham New Theatre\n\nThe Nottingham New Theatre is a playhouse and production company based on University Park campus, Nottingham, England. It is funded in part by the University of Nottingham Students’ Union and constitutes one of the Union’s Media Groups (alongside University Radio Nottingham, Nottingham Student Television Station, Impact Magazine, and TEC PA and Lighting).\n\nIt is the only entirely student-run theatre in England, with around 25 individual shows across two seasons per academic year, spanning 6 performances a week, to total around 100 live performances every year.\n\nWith a long and rich history, the Nottingham New Theatre has had a steady stream of members through its doors across many departments for the last 70 years.\n\n1926 - Nottingham Student Players\n\nBefore the Nottingham New Theatre was Dramsoc, and before Dramsoc was Nottingham Student Players. Occasionally including staff alongside students, Nottingham Student Players put on drama and musicals, such as Aucassin and Nicolete (June 4-5th 1926).\n\n1927 - Formation of Dramsoc\n\n\n\nThe University College Nottingham Dramatic Society (Dramsoc) performed its first play in 1928: A.A. Milne’s Mr Pim Passes By.\n\nThe society offered members an opportunity to read, discuss, produce and enact plays.\n\n1940s - Formation of TEC\n\nPreviously The University of Nottingham Technical Executive Committee, and now TEC PA and Lighting, this group had oversight of a number of departments across the university and Students’ Union. The Stage Productions Department was responsible for lighting and sound in the student theatre.\n\nThe SPD Manager also served as Technical Director of Dramsoc, in addition to overseeing the electrics at the annual University Opera, performed in the Great Hall of Trent Building.\n\n1945 - Earliest New Theatre Graduate\n\nThe earliest graduate in our records. Think you can beat that? Just drop us a line.\n\n1958 - Nottingham's Everyman Club\n\nNottingham’s Everyman Club was formed in 1958, to encourage students and local people in the city, who were interested in theatre, to collaborate on productions. The club had some notable successes in the 1960s.\n\n1960s - Golden Age of Dramsoc\n\nThe production of Coriolanus reached the finals of the National Student Drama Competition, while The Taming of the Shew enjoyed a week-long tour of Germany. The society also took George Bernard Shaw’s St Joan to the outdoor Minack Theatre in Cornwall.\n\n1966 - Earliest 'New Theatre' Record\n\nWhile not called the ‘New Theatre’, this is the earliest record of student theatre in Nottingham. At this time, members of the University of Nottingham Technical Committee were responsible for the technical areas of the student theatre.\n\n1980s - Disbandment, and the Nottingham Theatre Group\n\nWhile Dramsoc was disbanded, all was not lost for theatre at Nottingham. The Nottingham Theatre Group (while not receiving any financial support from the Students’ Union) was formed to present an annual revue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nThese shows were developed and previewed in New Theatre. NTG would typically rent a venue in Edinburgh and fit it out as a temporary theatre, sub-letting the space and equipment to other Fringe groups such as Durham Student Theatre or Bristol Revunions.\n\n2001 - A New Foyer\n\n\n\nThanks to a gracious alumni donation, we were able to fund the construction of our foyer. This housed internal access to the Box Office, toilets, and bar. Its glass exterior created a fresh and open environment for all visitors.\n\n2011 - UNCUT\n\nAnother season of shows allows for more opportunity, and the UNCUT Season—now Fringe—is just that. Providing a platform for experimental, new, or more intimate theatre, this season runs parallel to the In House season. The majority of initial performances were located outside of the Theatre.\n\n2012 - Demolition of Archaeology\n\nThe New Theatre was, up till this point, housed within the department of Archaeology and Classics. Over the summer, the New Theatre became its own freestanding building—now a popular campus landmark. Among several other rooms the foyer was given a generous extension.\n\n2012 - Studios A and B (and more rooms!)\n\n\n\nOur small blackbox studios—used as rehearsal rooms, meeting spaces, performance venues, and occasional bar—were created.\n\nThe costume cupboard and props corridor were also refurbished, providing some long-needed new space.\n\n2012 - The Nottingham New Theatre\n\nFollowing a members’ vote, The New Theatre became The Nottingham New Theatre, and a new logo was born. This change was made to better represent the theatre on the national stage.\n\n2013 - Nottingham New Theatre meets Lakeside Arts\n\nIn the first of what would become an annual partnership, the students of New Theatre collaborated with the professional theatremakers at Lakeside Arts, another on-campus theatre, to perform Lysistrata.\n\n2015 - STUFF\n\nThe first year of the STUdent Fringe Festival—STUFF—paved the way for future years. An Edinburgh preview event, including shows from external production companies, including Nottingham New Theatre alumni, all coming together to end the summer term on campus.\n\n2016 - 50th Anniversary\n\nThe Nottingham New Theatre’s inaugural alumni dinner took place for the theatre’s 50th Anniversary. Over 100 alumni guests were welcomed to tours of the theatre spaces, followed by a formal dinner in the Great Hall and Senate Chamber.\n\n2017 - Unscripted\n\nUnscripted allows students of any and all experience to take part in the theatre life. With no auditions, the group produces a semi-devised piece. The first performance, held in February, was Camp MacBeth.\n\n",
