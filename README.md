# gingertronmk1.github.io

A Jekyll website containing my CVs and other projects.
Recently I have migrated it to use NPM for asset compilation - SASS and JS are found now in the `_assets` folder, and they compile to the `dist` folder.

# Installation and Running

1. Refer to the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) for installing Jekyll and its dependencies.
2. Run `npm install && npm run dev` to get all the assets up-to-speed
3. That should be it...
4. (Optional) If you want the development environment, copy `/misc/development.yml` into `/_data`.
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to make sure it works.
