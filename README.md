# Installation and Running

1. Refer to the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) for installing Jekyll and its dependencies.
2. That should be it...
3. (Optional) If you want the development environment, copy `/misc/development.yml` into `/_data`.
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to make sure it works.
