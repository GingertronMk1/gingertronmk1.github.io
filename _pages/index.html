      I mostly do PHP/JavaScript/CSS but I'm very versatile, with experience in
      a wide number of languages from C to Haskell.


      I also have a lot of experience with broader development tools, such as
      Git, and I prefer to use `vim` for my text editing.
      It's what I've used since I started programming, and now I can't stop.

      I also have a great deal of experience in sound and video design.

      
      In 2019 I was the "emergency sound designer" at the National Student Drama
      Festival, as well as having done sound and video work for a number of
      student productions at the Nottingham New Theatre
