### I'm Jack, a software developer

I mostly do PHP/JavaScript/CSS but I'm very versatile, with experience in a wide number of languages from C to Haskell.

I also have a lot of experience with broader development tools, such as Git, and I prefer to use `vim` for my text editing.
It's what I've used since I started programming, and now I can't stop.
