    I need an honest answer from you. I don’t mind if it’s not the answer I want to hear, I need to know the truth. Did YOU ask me out or was it Adam messing around on your facebook??? my friend has a differnet number in her phone for your mobile and I don’t know who has the correct one. She showed me a text that sadi ‘ily loads’ and i NEED to know who it was that sent her that message. It now says that I am not your friend on facebook and my best friends that you had have also said that you blocked them on facebook. I need the truth. If it was YOU sending those messages to another girl then I CAN NOT GO OUT WITH YOU!!! Plese Please Please reply asap. Im so confused I honestly thought that you liked me and now i dont know what to feel :S :( :’(
