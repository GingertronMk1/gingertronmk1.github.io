    How’re you?
- person: them
  message: >
    I’m fine thanks you?
- person: me
  message: >
    Awful :(
- person: them
  message: >
    Whyy?
- person: me
  message: >
    Well you know I like Hannah?
- person: them
  message: >
    Yeahh
- person: me
  message: >
    Well I was planning on asking her out on her birthday.
- person: me
  message: >
    And I found out today that she’s going out with some other guy.
- person: them
  message: >
    Ohhh
- person: me
  message: >
    I thought we were really close
- person: me
  message: >
    If she would have just told me they were about to go I would’ve told her that I wanted to go out with her.
- person: me
  message: >
    And he’s not some guy that’s going to dump her in a week either.
- person: me
  message: >
    They’re going to be together for a long time :(
- person: them
  message: >
    Ohh, i was gonna say i would advise not to ask her on her birthday cause if she said no it would be awkward for her cause she would feel bad for saying no after you gave her the present
- person: them
  message: >
    but apart from that who is the guy?
- person: me
  message: >
    He’s called Matt.
- person: me
  message: >
    I see him on the way to school sometimes.
- person: me
  message: >
    He’s pretty nice. And that’s the problem.
- person: me
  message: >
    I know he’s a better guy than me so I’ll never be able to ask her out without her comparing me to him.
- person: them
  message: >
    What’s the problem with him being nice?
- person: me
  message: >
    Because he’s a nice guy she’ll be with him for ages. I was hoping to have a great time with her tomorrow on sports day and maybe in the holidays but now I can’t because she’ll be with him.
- person: them
  message: >
    Ohhh okay.
- person: me
  message: >
    I want to tell her, but I know it won’t change anything. :(
- person: them
  message: >
    It’s up to you whether you tell her or not but it might make things more complicated.
- person: me
  message: >
    Yeah.....
- person: me
  message: >
    I’ll try and speak with her tomorrow about it.
