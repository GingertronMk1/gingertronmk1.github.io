# Profile
I am a Computer Science graduate with a 2:1 MSci.
I have excellent communication and administrative skills developed from being a member of a number of committees during my time at the University of Nottingham.
I am a strong worker under pressure, able to quickly make decisions based on information available to me, and I have a good ability to convert someone's request into a more technical format, whatever that format might be.
I am also a strong collaborator within a team, and am always keen to share any experience, tips, or tricks with those who need or want them in order for the team I am a part of to be as strong as it can be.

# Skills
As a result of my having been Master Carpenter at the Nottingham New Theatre I am proficient in the usage and training of many power and manual tools.
Beyond this I am a fast learner, having had to become familiar with new pieces of equipment as I added them to the workshop inventory.
I was heavily involved in set construction - credited as such for 8 shows over the two years of my involvement - as well as broader areas of tech and backstage, having been a venue technician at the small fringe festival the New Theatre runs yearly, and having been brought into multiple shows as "emergency sound designer".
